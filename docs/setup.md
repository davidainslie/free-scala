# Setup

Apologies I shall only cover **Mac** - One day I may include Linux and Windows.

Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) for easy package management on Mac:

```shell
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Installation essentials:

```shell
brew update
brew install scala
brew install sbt
brew install terraform
brew install awscli
brew install jq
```
